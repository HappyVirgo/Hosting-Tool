# Host-Tools-App

This is the admin UI for Host Tools.

It uses the [Azia](https://www.bootstrapdash.com/demo/azia/v1.0.0/template/index.html) template for styling.

This uses react-scipts to proxy the api calls to the Host Tools live servers.  These teriminal commands should get you up and running (you might need to log in to [Host Tools](https://hosttools.com) before you can view the admin interface).

```
npm install
npm start
```

Let me know if you have any issues t@hosttools.com
